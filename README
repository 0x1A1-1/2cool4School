This is the group final project for ECE551

Team Name: 2'b10 Cool 3'b100 School
Team Members: Xiao, Matt, Christian, Heng
Project: Logic Analyzer

NOTES:
-capture_cntrl_for_later_use.sv was deleted. use capture_cntrl.sv from now on. 
-SEE NOTES IN capture_cntrl.sv!!!
-ADDED dig_core.sv to project

TODO:
[] implement state machine logic in cmd_cfg
[] channel_trigger_logic should be "negedge set_armed"
[] capture_cntrl needs to output ram_addr for cmd_cfg
[] instantiate and connect all modules in dig_core.sv

DONE:
[-] Q3 & PROOF 
[-] Q2 testbench
[-] channel trigger logic has been modifeid by Heng, should now works
[-] there are two versions of capture_cntrl, one is simple version, named capture_ctrl, should covered what we need for HW5_2, full verision is capture_cntrl_for_later_use, which should covered full functions for this unit
[-] implement dumping logic in cmd_cfg. We have modified Heng's version and is the one we will be working with
[-] match and mask checking should be        mask & (match ^ data) == (match ^ data)       in UART_RX_trig
