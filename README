This is the group final project for ECE551

TEAM 2'b10 Cool 3'b100 School

Project: Logic Analyzer

Team: Xiao, Matt, Christian, Heng

TODO:
[] implement state machine logic in cmd_cfg
[] match and mask checking should be        mask & (match ^ data) == (match ^ data)       in UART_RX_trig
[] channel_trigger_logic should be "negedge set_armed"

DONE:
[-]Q3 & PROOF 
[-]Q2 testbench
[-]channel trigger logic has been modifeid by Heng, should now works
[-]there are two versions of capture_cntrl, one is simple version, named capture_ctrl, should covered what we need for HW5_2, full verision is capture_cntrl_for_later_use, which should covered full functions for this unit
[-] implement dumping logic in cmd_cfg. We have modified Heng's version and is the one we will be working with
